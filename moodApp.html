        <h3 class="moodSection">1. Overview</h3>
        <p>
            A UX research project focused on generating <strong>design recommendations for a user-centred
                mood-tracking app</strong>, emphasising customisability and flexibility to address <strong>gaps in
                personalisation</strong> found in existing apps. The final case study slides are embedded below, and the
            specific
            deliverables can be
            viewed at the Figma link below.<br><br></p>

        <h3 class="moodSection">2. Problem &amp; Goal</h3>
        <p>Most mood-tracking apps offer <strong>limited flexibility</strong>, leading to low user engagement over time.
            Through this project, I set out to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Investigate <strong>pain points and frustrations</strong> in existing mood-tracking experiences</li>
            <li>Understand user attitudes toward <strong>social features and community sharing</strong></li>
            <li>Identify what keeps users <strong>motivated and consistent</strong></li>
            <li>Provide clear <strong>design recommendations</strong> based on qualitative and quantitative insights
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="moodSection">3. Research</h3>
        <p>I took a mixed-methods approach to understand how users <strong>track their emotions</strong>, what
            <strong>challenges</strong> they face in
            doing so consistently, and what features could make mood tracking feel more <strong>intuitive, rewarding,
                and
                sustainable.</strong> This involved collecting both <strong>quantitative and qualitative</strong> data
            to surface user behaviors,
            needs, and blockers.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Competitor analysis</strong> of 2 direct and 1 indirect app</li>
            <li><strong>Literature review</strong> of current mood-tracking app trends and uses</li>
            <li><strong>Survey</strong> (20+ responses) tracking habits, motivation, and drop-off patterns</li>
            <li>3 <strong>user interviews</strong> to dive deeper into user habits, preferences, and pain points</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Key Insights</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speed matters:</strong> 100% of users preferred mood tracking to take one minute or less. Time
                was the most cited
                challenge in both open-ended and scaled responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Customization is key:</strong> 86% wanted to customize how they represent moods, and preferred
                flexibility in
                tracking frequency. This reflected major gaps seen in competitor apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Insights drive motivation:</strong> All users selected "mood analysis and insights" as a top
                desired feature,
                often linking it to long-term personal growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Forgetfulness is a barrier:</strong> 60% of former users stopped tracking due to forgetting, and
                77% rated
                reminders as highly useful.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mixed views on social features:</strong> While over half were unlikely to connect with others on
                the app, a third
                expressed interest in features like following users or sharing mood streaks. Interview responses
                revealed more openness to these features than the survey data suggested.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div id="thematic"></div>

        <h3 class="moodSection">4. Synthesis</h3>
        <p>I synthesised my research findings to identify <strong>core user needs, behaviors, and motivations</strong>
            that would shape
            my product strategy. Through persona creation, user journey mapping, and thematic analysis, I clarified
            where
            <strong>existing tools fall short</strong> and where new features could better support <strong>long-term
                engagement</strong> and user needs.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Created <strong>2 user personas</strong> to reflect contrasting needs around routine-based vs.
                reflective mood tracking.</li>
            <li>Developed a <strong>user journey map</strong> that illustrated a common path and friction points.</li>
            <li>Used <strong>thematic network mapping</strong> to uncover major pain points like time burden,
                forgetfulness, and lack of personalisation.</li>
            <li>Used survey and interview data to <strong>prioritise features</strong> based on user value and
                implementation
                feasibility.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="moodJourney"></div>

        <h3 class="moodSection">5. Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Based on my research and synthesis, I developed a set of <strong>design recommendations</strong> to guide the
            next phase of
            ideation and prototyping. These focus on <strong>flexibility, meaningful insights, and optional social
                connection</strong> to
            support <strong>long-term user engagement.</strong></p>
        <p class="rec"><strong>Customisability as a Core Feature</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow users to choose how and how often they track moods (e.g. once/day, multiple times/day, or
                flexible).</li>
            <li>Offer multiple ways to represent moods (e.g. emojis, colors, sliders, text), reflecting the personal
                nature of emotional experiences.</li>
            <li>Design a modular interface that supports personalization over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="rec"><strong>Insightful and Actionable Mood Analysis</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prioritize features that help users interpret mood data over time, not just visualize it.</li>
            <li>Introduce light-touch recommendations or prompts based on trends (e.g. "You tend to feel more positive
                after journaling").</li>
            <li>Highlight patterns to support emotional awareness and self-discovery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="rec"><strong>Optional and User-Defined Community Layer</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consider introducing social features that are opt-in and user-controlled.</li>
            <li>Explore formats like anonymous mood-sharing, community prompts (Reddit-style), or private friend-based
                tracking.</li>
            <li>Provide toggles for visibility, notifications, and interaction level to ensure privacy and comfort.</li>
        </ul>
