        <h3 class="spotifySection">1. Overview</h3>
        <p>A UX research and interface design project focused on <strong>enhancing Spotifyâ€™s mobile social
                experience</strong>. I co-led
            the project end-to-end, from initial concept to final prototype, exploring user needs around music sharing
            and
            designing new social analytics and messaging features, including a reimagined Jam experience to support
            connection and discovery.</p>

        <h3 class="spotifySection">2. Problem &amp; Goal</h3>
        <p>While Spotify excels at individual listening experiences, its <strong>social features remain limited and
                unintuitive</strong>â€”particularly the Jam feature. Users lack integrated tools for in-app messaging,
            viewing follower
            analytics, or exploring music compatibility with friends.</p>
        <p>This project aimed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand how users <strong>currently interact</strong> with Spotifyâ€™s social functions</li>
            <li>Identify <strong>pain points and opportunities for sociability-focused</strong> feature growth</li>
            <li>Explore how <strong>music spreads</strong> among friend groups, both on and off Spotify</li>
            <li>Highlight the potential <strong>social value of music-centred</strong> interaction</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="spotifySection">3. Research</h3>
        <p>We began with a mixed-methods research approach to understand how users engage with Spotify socially, what
            <strong>gaps</strong> they experience, and what <strong>new features</strong> might enhance music-centred
            connection. This involved gathering
            both <strong>quantitative and qualitative</strong> data to identify key behaviors, needs, and pain points.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Competitor analysis</strong> of 5 direct and 3 indirect apps</li>
            <li><strong>Usability audit</strong> of Spotifyâ€™s existing social features</li>
            <li><strong>Survey</strong> (60+ responses) exploring social behaviors and feature gaps</li>
            <li>6 <strong>user interviews</strong> to dive deeper into user habits, preferences, and pain points</li>
            <li><strong>Graffiti wall</strong> ideation (2x) to gather rapid user impressions and feature desires</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Key Insights</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Music sharing often <strong>initiates and strengthens</strong> social bonds.</li>
            <li>Users experience <strong>frustration with the current Jam feature's</strong> complexity and lack of
                interaction.</li>
            <li>Many Spotify users <strong>rely on third-party apps</strong> to fill social interaction gaps.</li>
            <li>Thereâ€™s a <strong>demand for real-time social features</strong>, like messaging and analytics sharing.
            </li>
            <li>Spotify users <strong>want easier ways to connect</strong> with friends and discover music together.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div id="compAnalysis"></div>


        <h3 class="spotifySection">4. Synthesis</h3>
        <p>After analyzing our research findings, we <strong>identified key patterns and user needs</strong> that would
            guide our design
            direction. These insights were synthesized into <strong>personas, journey maps, and affinity maps</strong>
            to highlight
            specific user pain points and areas for growth.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Created <strong>2 user personas</strong> to represent key segments of Spotify users.</li>
            <li>Developed <strong>user journey maps</strong> that illustrated common paths and friction points.</li>
            <li>Used <strong>thematic network mapping</strong> to visualize and prioritise core user needs and feature
                requests.</li>
            <li>Conducted an <strong>affinity mapping exercise</strong> to identify themes and key trends from
                qualitative data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Need Statements</h4>
        <p>Based on the synthesis of our research, we formulated need statements that clearly define the <strong>core
                problems</strong>
            to solve for Spotify users. These statements served as a foundation for ideation and feature prioritisation.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users need an <strong>intuitive way to share music with friends</strong>, without technical barriers, to
                foster social
                connection.</li>
            <li>Spotify users need a seamless way to <strong>see and track their friendsâ€™ listening activity</strong>
                and music
                preferences.</li>
            <li>Users need more <strong>personalized ways to discover new music through connections</strong> with
                others, both within and
                outside Spotify.</li>
            <li>Users need a <strong>messaging feature</strong> within Spotify to communicate easily about shared music
                interests and
                recommendations.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="persona"></div>
        <div id="journey"></div>

        <h3 class="spotifySection">5. Ideation &amp; Prioritisation</h3>
        <p>With a solid understanding of user needs, we moved into the ideation phase. The goal was to <strong>identify
                and
                prioritise the most impactful features to address user pain points</strong>. Using a combination of
            creative ideation
            and strategic analysis, we narrowed down our ideas to those with the highest potential for user impact and
            feasibility.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Creative Matrix:</strong> We brainstormed multiple ideas and used the creative matrix to
                evaluate their potential based on user needs and technical feasibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritisation Matrix:</strong> We assessed ideas by impact and effort, ensuring that the most
                valuable features were prioritised in our design process.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Definition:</strong> We outlined the key features of the product, focusing on social
                analytics, music sharing, and messaging integration.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="prioritisation"></div>

        <h3 class="spotifySection">6. Design</h3>
        <p>The design phase followed a <strong>two-pronged approach</strong>: redesigning the existing <strong>Jam
                feature</strong> and <strong>introducing new
                features</strong> that addressed the social interaction and discovery needs of Spotify users. We also
            incorporated
            <strong>in-app messaging</strong> to streamline interactions between users and enhance the overall social
            experience.
        </p>

        <h4>Design Outputs</h4>
        <p>
            Throughout this process, we produced <strong>wireframes, storyboards, and high-fidelity prototypes</strong>
            to visualize the
            user interface. Each iteration was validated with usability tests to ensure the designs aligned with user
            needs and expectations.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wireframes:</strong> Low-fidelity wireframes were created to map out the layout for the Jam
                feature and the new features.</li>
            <li><strong>Prototypes:</strong> High-fidelity prototypes in Figma were developed for the Jam feature,
                Friends' Frequency, Local Listeners, and the messaging interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Usability Testing &amp; Iteration:</strong> We conducted several rounds of usability testing to
                refine the interactions, ensuring ease of use and functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="wireframes"></div>
        <div id="storyboard"></div>

        <h4>Redesigning the Jam Feature</h4>
        <p>
            The Jam feature was identified as unintuitive and challenging for users. We redesigned it to <strong>improve
                ease of
                use and enhance its social functionality</strong>, ensuring a seamless experience for users when
            engaging with their
            friendsâ€™ music choices. The goal was to make the feature more intuitive and promote more spontaneous, in-app
            musical sharing.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Design Focus:</strong> Simplify the user interface and improve accessibility to increase user
                engagement and ease of sharing.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing &amp; Iteration:</strong> The redesign went through multiple iterations based on usability
                testing feedback, which highlighted areas for more clarity and reduced cognitive load.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="jamDesign"></div>

        <h4>New Features</h4>
        <p>
            To enhance social interaction, we introduced two new features: <strong>Friends' Frequency</strong> and
            <strong>Local
                Listeners</strong>. These features were designed to help users discover and connect with others based on
            shared
            musical tastes and social data.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Friends' Frequency:</strong> This feature displayed mutual followersâ€™ top artists, songs, and
                playlists, allowing users to better understand their social music circles. It aimed to increase
                collaboration and discoverability among friends.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Listeners:</strong> Users could see compatibility scores with others within their city or
                geographic area, enabling music-based interactions and connections at a local level.</li>
            <li><strong>In-App Messaging:</strong> To improve communication between users, we integrated an in-app
                messaging feature that allowed users to easily share music and interact around shared interests.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="friendsFreqDesign"></div>
        <div id="localList"></div>


        <h3 class="spotifySection">7. Outcome</h3>
        <p>
            The redesign of the Jam feature, along with the introduction of the <strong>Friends' Frequency</strong> and
            <strong>Local
                Listeners</strong> features, significantly enhanced the social experience on Spotify. Users now have a
            more
            intuitive way to share music with friends, discover new artists based on mutual interests, and engage with
            the broader community through localized music discovery. In-app messaging further strengthened the
            connection between users, making interactions seamless.
        </p>

        <h4>Final Interface Concept</h4>
        <p>
            The final interface concept integrated all three key features in a way that was visually cohesive and
            functionally streamlined. The redesigned Jam feature made it <strong>easy for users to share their music
                moments</strong>,
            while Friends' Frequency and Local Listeners provided the <strong>social and discovery-driven
                functionalities</strong> that
            users had requested. The added in-app messaging feature created a seamless interaction flow.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-Centred Design:</strong> We learned the importance of continuously iterating on designs
                based on user feedback to ensure that features truly align with user needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Interaction Enhancements:</strong> Social features must feel integrated and natural
                within the app to ensure long-term engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing is Crucial:</strong> Iterating through wireframes, prototypes, and usability tests
                helped us refine the final product and make the user experience as intuitive as possible.</li>
        </ul>
